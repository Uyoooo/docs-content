Postman is an API client that allows you to build, test and manage APIs through a graphic interface. The platform includes features that make it easy for you to: 

  - create and test APIs
  - import APIs 
  - work collaboratively with other users
  - create different environments with unique variables
  - display responses in several programming languages
  - create API request collections and perform bulk actions 
  - configure granular request authorization rules, using different authorization types
  - capture and monitor request data (status, time, size)

In this tutorial you will learn how to import Scaleway APIs into Postman, configure your environment variables and authentication and how to share your workspace with other users.

## Importing Scaleway APIs into Postman

1. Click **Workspaces** > **Create Workspace** in the top menu of the Postman interface.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-postman-create-workspace.webp" />

2. Enter a name and description and select a visibility setting for your workspace. Your workspace displays.

3. Go to the Scaleway [developers website](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/) and select a product API to download. 

  In this tutorial, we use the [Scaleway Instances API](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/instance/api/).

4. Click **Download OpenAPI**.

5. Click **Collections** > **Import** in the side menu of the Postman interface.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-postman-import.webp" />

6. Drag and drop the Instances Open API `yml` file into into the indicated space to upload. 

7. Click **Import** to conclude. 
  
  The Instances API displays under the **Collections** tab in the side menu. The API is organized into files, following the different request categories (including servers, images, placement groups, IPs).

## Setting up an environment

Postman environments are sets of key/value pairs. They spaces in which you can store your authentication information to use as variables with your collections. 

In this section we show you how to create an environment with environment variables for a Scaleway project.

1. Click **Create Environment**. 

2. Enter a name for your environment. 

3. Configure your variables, as such:

    - **VARIABLE** - enter the key for your variable.
    - **TYPE** - select between default, which will be visible in plaintext, and secret, will mask the values on the screen.
    - **INTIAL VALUE** - this is the value shown to other users when you share the variable in a collection, environment or globals.
    - **CURRENT VALUE** - this is the value used when you send a request.

  In this tutorial, we will include a project ID, an access key and a secret key for the project.
